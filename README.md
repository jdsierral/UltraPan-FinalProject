# UltraPan-FinalProject
Final Project Repo for 256A at CCRMA


## Summary

This is my final project for 256A at CCRMA. It is a multichannel panner system plugin adaptable to any number of speakers in any topology. It is based on time arrival difference and distance amplitude calculations to make it available for any number of speakrs.

## Usage

Currently it is a VST/AU plugin for using in a regular channel strip inside a compatible DAW. The user can determine the position of the object in R3 space and change it in real time. The speaker positions need to be defined by the user according to its own speaker arrangement.

## Code Description

The current repo contains various plugins and tools used during the development of the main plugin but they are fully functional aswell so they might be of use to the end user for testing purposes.

## Example of Use

In the future an example video or audio will be available here; meanwhile a preview of what it will look like can be found here:
